A website consisting some facilities for [our university](https://ist.edu.bd) CSE batch 2019-2020.

It's corona time, everything is locked up. Our classes are held online. As most of us are careless about class, study and all that stuff, almost everyone (including me sometimes) used to ask simple things about online classes, our university, class routine etc.

I was really angry watching those messages asking silly things. So I created a small webapp named [**Prodipto27**](https://prodipto27.github.io). It consists of the things we really needed. Code's [here](https://github.com/prodipto27/prodipto27.github.io/).

It consists:
- Online Class Credentials of all the teachers for easy access.
- Our online class routine.
- Our course syllabus.
- Some PDFs of our books.
- Link to recorded online classes.

I've used [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/web) to design the webpage. I didn't want to waste my time designing the whole webapp. 

I've added [PWA](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) so that this web app can be installed on any device running [Chromium based browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)).

I've also added a WebView version (which uses PWA caching of course) which can be installed on any Android device without having a Chrome browser.

Some people may ask, why this project isn't hosted in my own Github account. I didn't want to buy a domain for it and the gh-pages subdomain starting with [ms-jahan](https://ms-jahan.github.io) (my GitHub username) will make it look like a project for my own purpose or need, not for our class. So, that's it.

Indeed, it was a fun project to do.
